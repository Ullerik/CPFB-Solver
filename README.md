# CPFB-Solver

## Todo:

* Add pre-rotation (for example y if you want to solve on white-green, or x if you want to solve on blue-orange) - textbox
* Add neturality (none, y2, x2y2, x2y, full) - radio, default none(?)
* Pick moves to use (from R, R2, R', U, U2, U', r..., u..., F..., f..., S..., M..., E...)
* Pick what to solve (from CPDLB+DLF, CPLine, CPFB, CPFB (on D), CP223, and CP223+EO)
* Ability to choose search and prune numbers (CPDLcorners require few moves, CP223+EO requires many)
* Add image of scramble, nice to have. Maybe image of only CPFB pieces?
