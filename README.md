# CPFB-Solver

## Website

ascenttree is currently hosting this - thanks a lot!

## Todo/might add in the future:
* Move selector (if you want to look for specific types of solutions)
* CEOR-0 solver/sorter (look for solutions that only use R U, R F, or U F, + widened of those + all slice moves)
* Mike stuff (RF-gen solutions)
* Add timer, or at least a line about how long it took to find the solutions (maybe progress as well?)
* Print out solutions as you find them, then update page to sort after all are found

* Add image of scramble, nice to have. Maybe image of only CPFB pieces?
